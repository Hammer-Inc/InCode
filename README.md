InCode
========
Pre-Note
--------
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>
You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

Installation
--------------
In order to install this project you need [Node Package Manager (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/) or an equivalent, all instructions will be documented assuming you are using npm.

Dependencies (dev and otherwise) are documented in the package.json and can be installed by running `npm install` in the install location.

Run
----------
To run the development server use the `npm start` command.

To run the production server build the application using `npm run build` and then run `serve -s build` to begin the production evironment server.

Notes
----------
The react component of this application only serves as the front-end/user interface to the code. 

Due to RMIT's assignment policy I am unable to release that code and thus is located in a private repository and results are served over API.
